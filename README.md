grunt-backbone
===============

Frontend development framework using grunt http://gruntjs.com/, backbone http://backbonejs.org/, Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com/ coffeeScript http://coffeescript.org/, SaSS http://sass-lang.com/, and Handlebars http://handlebarsjs.com/

Single page apps require careful management otherwise they become very difficult to maintain and extend, a well-considered architecture, modular development and code abstraction are key to efficient development and maintenance.

The goal of this project is to lay out a robust (but not fixed) front-end development framework that can be easily tailored to suit any particular technological or architectural requirement and aid the software development lifecycle through different environments.
